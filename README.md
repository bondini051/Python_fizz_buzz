# Python_fizz_buzz

I am new to Python and Computer Science in general. I am building skills in data analysis.  I have had the pleasure of meeting very intelligent and very interesting people in computer science that have skills that I want to attain.  Many told me of the "fizz buzz" question and asked how long it would take for me to complete.  

The Fizz Buzz problem that I was asked to complete was to write a program that:
1 - counts from 0-100.
2 - prints "fizz" when number is divisible by 3
3 - prints "buzz" when the number is divisible by 5
4 - prints "fizz buzz" when the number is divisible by 3 & 5

This simple project was done after a few months of python experience.  It took me around 9 minutes (timed via Toggl) to built this simple program. I did this project in a Jupyter Notebook because I like the way it looks as a report rather than just code. 

After I built and completed it I went and looked how others solved the "Fizz Buzz" problem. I wrote a simple if, elif, else loop. There were many other ways the question was posed and answered.  I would appreciate feedback and comments that will help me to become a better programmer and analyst.
